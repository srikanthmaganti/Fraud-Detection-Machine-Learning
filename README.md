 Detecting Financial Fraud using Machine Learning						                                               

1.Implemented a machine learning model that predicts the probability of the first transaction of a new user is fraudulent or not

2.Exploratory Data Analysis and creating new features from the existing features which contributed significantly in the evaluation

3.Building ML pipeline for all the derived features or building feature engineering pipeline

4.After deriving the features the corresponding package is deployed in PyPi in order to use it as Global package(fraud_package)

5.Building a framework by end-to-end implementation of machine learning pipelines for feature engineering, and models

6.Random Forest performed well to some extent but Balanced Random Forest outperforms in classifying fraud vs no fraud
