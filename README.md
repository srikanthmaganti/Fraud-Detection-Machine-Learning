 Detecting Financial Fraud using Machine Learning						                                               

1.Implemented a machine learning model that predicts the probability of the first transaction of a new user is fraudulent
2.Building a framework by end-to-end implementation of machine learning pipelines for feature engineering, and models 
3.Random Forest performed well to some extent but Balanced Random Forest outperforms in classifying fraud vs no fraud
